This layout was completely made by me :)

## How it works

This project is divided into two parts:

1. Backend (You can find here: https://github.com/samuelfcf/repoprovas-back)
2. Frontend (This repository)

---

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Running the Frontend

```bash

# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/samuelfcf/repoprovas-front

# Access the project folder cmd/terminal
$ cd repoprovas-front

# Install the dependencies
$ yarn install

# If you want to run your app on localhost, create a .env file with the environment variable pointing to your local server.

# Run the application in development mode
$ yarn start

# The server will start at port: 3000

```

You can find an .env.example <a href="https://github.com/samuelfcf/repoprovas-front/blob/main/.env.exemple">here</a>.
